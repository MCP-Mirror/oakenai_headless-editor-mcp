# Headless Code Editor - Core Architecture Documentation

## 1. Architectural Overview

The Headless Code Editor is built on a modular, service-oriented architecture that leverages the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for code intelligence and Monaco Editor's core functionality for text manipulation. The system is designed to be language-agnostic while providing rich editing capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### Core Design Principles

1. Separation of Concerns
   - Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Clear boundaries between language-specific and language-agnostic code
   - Modular design allowing easy extension and maintenance

2. Protocol-Based Communication
   - LSP for language intelligence
   - MCP for client-server interaction
   - Internal service communication through well-defined interfaces

3. State Management
   - Centralized session management
   - Immutable edit history
   - Transactional edit operations

4. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error tracking
   - Graceful degradation
   - Detailed error reporting

## 2. Core Components

### LSP Manager

The LSP Manager serves as the central coordinator for language-specific functionality. It manages language server lifecycles and provides a unified interface for language operations.

Key Responsibilities:
- Language server lifecycle management
- Server configuration and initialization
- Request routing and response handling
- Error handling and recovery
- Resource management

Configuration Management:
- Server-specific settings
- Workspace configuration
- Feature flags
- Performance tuning

### Document Manager

The Document Manager handles all document-related operations and maintains document state. It provides a consistent interface for document manipulation regardless of the underlying language.

State Management:
- Document versioning
- Change tracking
- Sync with language servers
- Cache management

Document Operations:
- Open/close documents
- Apply changes
- Track modifications
- Handle concurrent edits

### Session Manager

The Session Manager maintains the state of editing sessions and coordinates between different components of the system.

Session Lifecycle:
- Creation and initialization
- State maintenance
- Resource cleanup
- Timeout handling

State Tracking:
- Edit history
- Validation state
- Language server state
- Resource usage

### Edit Operation Handler

The Edit Operation Handler processes and validates edit operations before applying them to documents.

Operation Processing:
- Operation validation
- Format preservation
- Change application
- History tracking

Validation Pipeline:
- Syntax checking
- Type checking
- Format validation
- Custom rules

## 3. MCP Server Integration

### Server Architecture

The MCP server acts as the bridge between clients and the Headless Code Editor's core functionality. It exposes a set of tools and capabilities that clients can use to interact with the editor.

Server Components:
1. Request Handler
   - Parses incoming requests
   - Routes to appropriate services
   - Handles response formatting
   - Manages error cases

2. Tool Registry
   - Registers available tools
   - Manages tool lifecycles
   - Handles tool discovery
   - Validates tool usage

3. Capability Manager
   - Tracks available features
   - Manages feature flags
   - Handles capability negotiation
   - Reports supported operations

### Tool Implementation

Tools are implemented as discrete operations that can be invoked through the MCP interface.

Core Tools:
1. Session Management
   - start_session: Creates new editing session
   - end_session: Closes existing session
   - get_session_info: Retrieves session state

2. Edit Operations
   - edit_code: Applies edit operations
   - validate_code: Performs code validation
   - format_code: Handles code formatting

3. Document Operations
   - get_document: Retrieves document content
   - save_document: Persists changes
   - revert_changes: Undoes changes

### State Management

The MCP server maintains state through various mechanisms:

1. Session State
   - Active sessions
   - Session configuration
   - Resource usage
   - Timeout tracking

2. Document State
   - Current content
   - Change history
   - Validation state
   - Format context

3. Operation State
   - Pending operations
   - Operation results
   - Error conditions
   - Performance metrics

### Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

1. Error Types
   - Protocol errors
   - Validation errors
   - Resource errors
   - Timeout errors

2. Error Recovery
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - State recovery
   - Resource cleanup
   - Error reporting

3. Error Reporting
   - Detailed error messages
   - Error categorization
   - Stack traces
   - Context information

## 4. Integration Points

### Client Integration

Clients interact with the system through:
1. MCP protocol messages
2. Tool invocations
3. State queries
4. Event notifications

### Language Server Integration

Language servers connect through:
1. LSP protocol
2. Configuration interface
3. Document sync
4. Diagnostic reporting

### Framework Integration

Framework support is provided through:
1. Framework detection
2. Custom validators
3. Specialized operations
4. Format preservation

## 5. Performance Considerations

### Resource Management

1. Memory Management
   - Document caching
   - Resource pooling
   - Garbage collection
   - Memory limits

2. CPU Usage
   - Operation batching
   - Async processing
   - Load balancing
   - Priority queues

3. I/O Handling
   - Buffered operations
   - Async I/O
   - Request throttling
   - Connection pooling

### Scalability

The system is designed to scale through:
1. Service isolation
2. Resource pooling
3. Load distribution
4. Request queuing

This architecture provides a robust foundation for the Headless Code Editor while maintaining flexibility for future extensions and improvements. The clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces make it easy to add new features or modify existing functionality without impacting other parts of the system.
